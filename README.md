# Nginx-Log-Analyzer
 DevOps Project Idea

Been looking into more code and project based stuff while out of work at the moment and caring, so I need something I can pickup and drop in an instant should the need arise.

Checking on the DevOps Project Ideas Roadmap - [Link](https://roadmap.sh/devops/projects) I saw this was a quick one I might be able to bash my brain against.

Ended up with a Python and Bash version of the script, the latter using things like awk, sort, and uniq.
